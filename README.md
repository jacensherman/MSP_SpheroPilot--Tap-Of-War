# MSP_SpheroPilot--Tap-Of-War
Ever play tug of war? In Tap of War you tap as fast as possible to get your Sphero to come to your side instead of your opponent's.

Getting Started
---------------------------
This project is made using a combination of sphero.js and nw.js (previously node-webkit). So the first steps will be to set up those and get them working properly together.

<strong>Step 1: Gathering everything you'll need</strong></br>
To get started all you need is a computer that has Node installed. If you don't yet have node installed, here is the link: https://nodejs.org/download/

<strong>Step 2: Initializing Your Project</strong></br>
Your next step is to open command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder where you want all your code to be. Once inside that folder, run the command ```npm init```

<strong>Step 3: Adding sphero.js and nw.js</strong></br>
This step should be very simple; you'll just be running two commands.</br>
1. ```npm install --save sphero```</br>
2. ```npm install nw```</br>
Sometimes one of these will error which I actually had happen. My solution was (sadly) to uninstall and reinstall node.
